     * Using Deque: Create a Deque, Qi of capacity K, that stores only useful elements of current
     * window of K elements. An element is useful if it is in current window and is greater than
     * all other elements on right side of it in current window. Process all array elements one
     * by one and maintain Qi to contain useful elements of current window and these useful
     * elements are maintained in sorted order. The element at front of the Qi is the largest
     * and element at rear/back of Qi is the smallest of current window.
     *
     * 1. Create a deque to store K elements.
     * 2. Run a loop and insert the first K elements in the deque. Before inserting the element,
     * check if the element at the back of the queue is smaller than the current element, if
     * it is so remove the element from the back of the deque until all elements left in
     * the deque are greater than the current element. Then insert the current element,
     * at the back of the deque.
     * 3. Now, run a loop from K to the end of the array.
     * 4. Print the front element of the deque.
     * 5. Remove the element from the front of the queue if they are out of the current window.
     * 6. Insert the next element in the deque. Before inserting the element, check if
     * the element at the back of the queue is smaller than the current element, if it is
     * so remove the element from the back of the deque until all elements left in the deque
     * are greater than the current element. Then insert the current element, at the back of the deque.
     * 7. Print the maximum element of the last window.
