     * 1. Base cases for the given problem are when the given number is 0 or 1, then return X;
     * 2. Create some variables, for storing the lower bound say l = 0, and for upper bound r = X / 2
     * (i.e, The floor of the square root of x cannot be more than x/2 when x > 1).
     * 3. Run a loop until l <= r, the search space vanishes
     * 4. Check if the square of mid (mid = (l + r)/2 ) is less than or equal to X, If yes then search
     * for a larger value in the second half of the search space, i.e l = mid + 1, update ans = mid
     * 5. Else if the square of mid is more than X then search for a smaller value in the first half
     * of the search space, i.e r = mid â€“ 1
